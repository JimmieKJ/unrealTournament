            A paragraph is simply one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one
            or more blank lines. (A blank line is any line that looks like a blank line — a
            line. <a href="index.html#bookmark1" >Second paragraph bookmark.</a> Containing nothing but spaces or tabs is considered blank.) Normal
            paragraphs should not be indented with spaces or tabs.
        </p>

        <a name="bookmark1" ></a>
        <p>
            The implication of the “one or more consecutive lines of text” rule is that
            Markdown supports “hard-wrapped” text paragraphs. This differs significantly
            from most other text-to-HTML formatters (including Movable Type’s “Convert Line
            Breaks” option) which translate every line break character in a paragraph into
            a &lt;br /&gt; tag.
        </p>

        <p>
            When you do want to insert a &lt;br /&gt; break tag using Markdown, you end a line
            with two or more spaces, then type return.
        </p>

            Yes, this takes a tad more effort to create a &lt;br /&gt;, but a simplistic “every
            line break is a &lt;br /&gt;” rule wouldn’t work for Markdown. Markdown’s email-style
            blockquoting and multi-paragraph list items work best — and look better — when
            you format them with hard breaks.
