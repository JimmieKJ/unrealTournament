; ConsoleVariables.ini
;
; This file allows to set console variables on engine startup (In undefined order).
; Console variables also can be set in engine ini files (e.g. BaseEngine.ini, DefaultEngine.ini) in the [SystemSettings] section.
; This file should be in the source control database (for the comments and to know where to find it)
; but kept empty from variables.
; A developer can change it locally to save time not having to type repetitive
; console variable settings. The variables need to be in the section called [Startup].
; Later on we might have multiple named sections referenced by the section name.
; This would allow platform specific or level specific overrides.
; The name comparison is not case sensitive and if the variable doesn't exists it's silently ignored.
;
; Example file content:
;
; [Startup]
; FogDensity = 0.9
; ImageGrain = 0.5
; FreezeAtPosition = 2819.5520 416.2633 75.1500 65378 -25879 0
