#
# This file tells Git about engine files that never really belong in source control.  They are usually build products, log 
# files and intermediate files generated from a compiler or the engine runtime.
#
#
# NOTE:
#  Paths that start with / match paths relative to the root (where the .gitignore file is)
#  Paths that end with / will match a folder and all files under it (but not a regular file with no extension)
#  Use * for wildcards.  Wildcards stop at path separators
#  Use ** for a wildcard that spans path separators
#  Paths in this file should use forward slash characters, not back slashes
#  Use \ to escape special characters like ! and #
#  Use ! to negate a previous pattern.  But it doesn't work if the parent sub-folder was masked out already.
# 


# Ignore project files in the root
/*.sln
*.suo
*.opensdf
*.sdf
/*.xcodeproj

# Derived data cache is never checked in
/*/DerivedDataCache/**

# Engine intermediates
/*/Intermediate/**
/*/Plugins/**/Intermediate/**

# NOTE: For now, we'll commit executable binaries too (game DLLs)
#/*/Binaries/**
#/*/Plugins/**/Binaries/**

# Ignore any saved local files
/*/Saved/**

# Other binaries
